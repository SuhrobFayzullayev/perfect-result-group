                      concepts such as "domain", "hosting", "server". These
                      concepts are explained in detail in the article. After
                      preparing the site on our personal computer, we need to
                      place it on the Internet. If you don't post it online, no
                      one will know about your site. But it's not the end of the
                      web, how can people find your site? - a question arises.
                      Therefore, it is necessary to make it possible for people
                      to find the site that you put on the Internet, but we will
                      talk about this in the next lessons. First, let's talk
                      about putting the site on the Internet. In general, we
                      will learn about how sites are located on the Internet and
                      how sites are named. To put any site on the Internet, a
                      domain and hosting are taken.

                      Over time, regular (offline) stores become less popular
                      and inconvenient for customers. Many products can be
                      easily purchased online. Internet store is a form of
                      electronic commerce, a website designed for selling goods
                      via the Internet. Customers of the online store can choose
                      goods online (on a computer or smartphone), place an order
                      for purchase, choose payment and delivery methods (and pay
                      through an electronic payment system). The goods in the
                      online store are presented in the form of a catalog (just

                      A mobile application or app is a computer program or
                      software application designed to run on a mobile device
                      such as a phone, tablet, or watch. Mobile applications
                      often stand in contrast to desktop applications which are
                      designed to run on desktop computers, and web applications
                      which run in mobile web browsers rather than directly on
                      the mobile device. Apps were originally intended for
                      productivity assistance such as email, calendar, and
                      contact databases, but the public demand for apps caused
                      rapid expansion into other areas such as mobile games,
                      factory automation, GPS and location-based services,
                      order-tracking, and ticket purchases, so that there are
                      now millions of apps available. Many apps require Internet
                      access. Apps are generally downloaded from app stores,
                      which are a type of digital distribution platforms.
